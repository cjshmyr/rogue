# rogue

## About
Small game experiment with TypeScript + Pixi.

To build, install TypeScript 2.3.2+ and compile with `tsc`. To run, open `game.html`.

If ran locally, depending on the browser's CORS restrictions (e.g. Chrome) you may need to host the page with a web server.

## 3rd party
3rd party libraries are currently committed to repository -- this may move to use npm. This includes:

[PixiJS (v4.5.1)](http://www.pixijs.com/)

[PixiJS-TypeScript definitions (v4.5.0)](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript/tree/v4.5.0)
