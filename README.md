## About
Small game experiment with TypeScript + Pixi.

To build, install typescript 2.3.2+ and compile with `tsc`. To run, open `game.html`.

## 3rd party
3rd party libraries are currently committed to repository -- eventually this will use npm. This includes:

[Pixi.js (v4.5.1)](http://www.pixijs.com/)

[Pixi-Typescript definitions (v4.5.0)](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript/tree/v4.5.0)
