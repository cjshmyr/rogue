# rogue

## About
Small rogue-like game experiment.

This was a sandbox to teach myself TypeScript and PixiJS, and to epxeriment with GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages deployments.

The project will not receive any major updates. It contains many unfinished features, but several functional ones (A* pathfinding, lighting).

To try it out: https://cjshmyr.github.io/rogue/

## Compiling
To build, install `npm` & `Gulp`, then run `npm i` and `gulp`.

To run, open `dist/index.html` with a live server (an extension is automatically recommended for Visual Studio Code workspaces).
