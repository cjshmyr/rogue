# rogue

## About
Small rogue-like game experiment with TypeScript + PixiJS.

To try it out, build the source, or check out http://shmyr.net/rogue/game.html.

The project will not be updated in its current state. It contains many unfinished features, and several functional ones (lighting, A* pathfinding, etc).

To build, install TypeScript 2.3.2+ and compile with `tsc`. To run, open `game.html`.

If ran locally, depending on the browser's CORS restrictions (e.g. Chrome) you may need to host the page with a web server like Mongoose.
